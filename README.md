# SkimLit-Project-with-NLP-and-TensorFlow (Ongoing)

## Introduction
The SkimLit project is designed to process textual documents and extract meaningful insights from them using NLP techniques and TensorFlow-based models. It can be used for a wide range of applications where understanding the tone and context of text is essential, including sentiment analysis, content recommendation, and topic classification.

## Project Features
### Text Processing: 
The project includes robust text processing capabilities for cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing text data for analysis.

### NLP Models: 
Utilizes NLP models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer models, to extract semantic information from text.

### Sentiment Analysis: 
Provides sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of the text, including positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

### Topic Classification: 
Classifies text documents into predefined topics or categories, allowing users to organize and filter content effectively.

### Context Understanding: 
Helps understand the context of text by analyzing the relationships between words and phrases in documents.
